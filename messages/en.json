    "title": "About Me",
    "content": "I'm a backend developer focused on solutions that work and last. I mainly work with Java + Spring Boot and Node.js + TypeScript/NestJS, but I’ve delivered production code with PHP/Laravel, C#/.NET and even React/React Native when the project needs it. I like solving real problems: less theory, more working software. If you need someone who understands the business, writes code that won’t become legacy tomorrow, and delivers on time, let’s talk."
